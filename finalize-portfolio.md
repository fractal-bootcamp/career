Your finalized personal site should have the following features:

- [] Portfolio of MANY projects (>5). The most impressive project first; even if it's a team project. Every project must be deployed, and must load quickly when clicked.
- [] "My Software/Research/Personal Moodboard" page, to show some personality -- what ideas and thinkers interest you? [example](https://schare.space/garden/moodboard.html)
- [] Professional Headshot (I will schedule one for all of you, but you need to use the picture you get)
- [] "Hire Me" page with compelling pitch.
- [] Links to your twitter & github
- [] any writing you have published that you enjoy
